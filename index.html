    <h2>Description</h2>

    <article>
      <p>
        Women with Baskets, Fish, and Crab was among the favorite paintings of
        the artist, Anita Magsaysay-Ho, displayed prominently in her living room
        before finding a home with one of her oldest friends. The piece melds
        together a celebration of Filipino craft, the strength of Filipina
        women, and the talent and technique of one of the country’s most
        celebrated painters. The baskets depicted invoke the industriousness and
        dedication involved in basket weaving—a practice Anita considered among
        the most beautiful of Filipino handicrafts. A similar level of mastery
        and precision was needed to portray these objects. Anita later related
        that she found the process challenging, with careful work needed to
        convey the curvature and to capture the interplay of shadows and of
        light. The original owner of the piece was Mrs. Charito Panganiban
        Melchor, a childhood neighbor of Anita’s whose friendship with the
        artist would span decades. It was ironically the storm clouds of war
        that brought these two young women together.

    <h2>Artist</h2>
    <article>
      <p id="info-artist">
        <span class="highlight">Anita Magsaysay-Ho</span> (born Anita Corpus
        Magsaysay; May 25, 1914 – May 5, 2012) was a Filipina painter who
        specialized in Social Realism and post-Cubism in regard to women in
        Filipino culture.[2] Magsaysay-Ho's work appeals to Modernism by
        utilizing more abstract designs and styles rather than realistic
        approaches.
